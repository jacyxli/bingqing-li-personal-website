#### Abstract

To balance the need for privacy and the benefits of big data analytics, regulators around the world are giving consumers control over their data, allowing them to choose whether or not to voluntarily share their purchase history data with firms. Intuition suggests that voluntary data sharing benefits consumers who can now choose to share their data only when it is profitable to do so. To investigate this argument, we built a model in which a monopolistic firm sells a repeatedly purchased product to consumers over two periods, and consumers decide whether or not to share their purchase history data with the firm, who can use it in the future to price-discriminate against them. We found that, compared to when data collection is completely outlawed, voluntary data sharing can benefit the firm but at the consumer’s expense. Moreover, regulations that mandate firms to better protect consumer data against data breaches can backfire on consumers. Finally, we show that under voluntary data sharing, a firm’s ability to offer consumers a monetary incentive to share their data can improve profits without hurting consumers. Taken together, these findings underscore the surprising effects of voluntary data sharing and caution public policymakers of how certain data policies that, on the surface, seem purely beneficial can lead to unintended consequences.

#### Abstract

Peer-to-peer marketplaces and the sharing economy are reshaping many markets. Airbnb is attractive to many customers because of its non-standardized, diverse selections and superior value over hotels, but Airbnb properties also come with more uncertainty than hotels. Images of the property can help resolve uncertainty. This study focuses on the background image (the image displayed in search results) and examines how the background image’s content features (living room, bedroom, and interior design) and aesthetic features (clarity, brightness, and contrast) affect the booking rate during a 16-night end-of-year holiday period. The authors develop a model that includes the amount of visual information, property characteristics, and host characteristics, and correct for endogeneity by using a pair of markets (New York City and San Francisco) to calculate propensity scores and construct instrumental variables. The results show that having a background image that features the living room and shows more interior design elements increases the booking rate, while featuring a bedroom decreases it. The effects of the content features are larger than the effects of the aesthetic features, and the effects are economically significant: for example, the effect of featuring the living room in the background image translates into a 35% increase in the booking rate, which amounts to $728 more revenue during the holiday period.
