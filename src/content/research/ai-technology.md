#### Abstract

Digital twins of customers (DToC) have emerged as a promising approach to simulate consumer thinking, feeling, and decision-making in marketing contexts. This research proposes and empirically tests a methodological framework that combines fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to construct LLM-based customer digital twins. Fine-tuning on user-generated content allows the model to internalize individual traits, preferences, and behaviors, while RAG equips the twin with real-time access to contextual product information. We demonstrate the framework using Amazon e-commerce data, constructing 306 personified digital twins and evaluating their performance in predicting both purchase decisions and review contents. The resulting digital twins achieve high accuracy in predicting future purchases (83%) and generate product reviews with strong semantic alignment to actual customer content (cosine similarity above 0.94). This method opens new possibilities for personalized marketing, pre-deployment campaign testing, and privacy-compliant consumer modeling. The findings contribute to emerging literature on generative AI and synthetic agents in marketing, advancing the conceptual and technical foundation for predictive, interactive, and individualized customer simulation.

### From GUI to BCI: Brain-Computer Interfaces Enabled Marketing

Revising for resubmission to _Journal of Marketing_

#### Abstract

The evolution of user interfaces, from graphical to immersive interfaces, has continually transformed how consumers and firms interact with each other. Now, with the advancements in neural interfaces, or brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), another significant shift in the dynamics between consumers and firms is on the horizon. This research draws attention to the advent of the neural interface era and provides a framework for examining its profound implications on consumer behavior and marketing. Introducing the notion of “interface-enabled marketing”, we develop a novel framework that maps consumer and marketing activities along the customer journey to four layers of human-machine interaction enabled by neural interfaces: 1) consumers at the user layer, 2) consumer electronics at the hardware layer, 3) neural decoding and marketing technology stack at the software layer, 4) marketing intelligence at the intelligence layer. Alongside the framework, we evaluate the technological advancements and challenges in harnessing BCIs for fulfilling marketing requirements. The study offers insights into how marketing practitioners and researchers can prepare for the paradigm shift brought forth by neural interfaces. Finally, we highlight the ethical and privacy issues that may arise from ubiquitous adoption of BCIs by consumers as part of their routine activities.
